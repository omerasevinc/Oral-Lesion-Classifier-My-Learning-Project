# Oral Lesion Classification

This project includes an artificial intelligence model to classify oral lesions as benign or malignant based on their images. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle platform and the Keras Xception model is used.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It consists of images of various types of oral lesions. There are a total of 1265 images, each with a label indicating whether it is benign or malignant. The dataset can be accessed from the following link:
[Oral Lesions: Malignancy Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedgobara/oral-lesions-malignancy-detection-dataset/data)


## Installation

To run the project, you need to install the required libraries first. You can install them using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Performance Evaluation

The project performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy. The performance of the model is assessed using a test dataset. Different hyperparameter settings and data augmentation techniques can be explored to improve the project's performance.
